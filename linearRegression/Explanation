Linear Regression
=================

Linear Regression is the simplest regression.
You need to find the best fitting line. That's where "Oridinary least square (OLS)" method come in.

"Oridinary least square (OLS):   1. First you need to find average of y values and cut through a line.( you get a horizontal line)  => " we name that point that line pass through on y axis called  b ".
                                    you calculate differences between data point and line (this is called finding residuals) =>(b-y)
                                 2.You need to for all the data points and then square each of them.   =>(b-y)squared
                                 3. Last sum of square all residuels. sum of all (b-y)squared
                                 4. Rotate your line a little bit and redo from 1 to 4 again.(Note : you already have a line so dont need to find mean again, just rotate your line and find residuals)

                                 The line with lowest sum of squared residuals is considered as the best fitting line.
                                
    
    equation => sum of square residuals = (b-y1)sqaured + (b-y2)sqaured + (b-y3)sqaured + (b-y4)sqaured +.... +(b-yn)sqaured 
    
    **Note -> we square every residuals to make sure not to cancel out each other.
     
     Now you get the best fitting line .
         equation => Y = intercept + slope * x (aka least squared)
