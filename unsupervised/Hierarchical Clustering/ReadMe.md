<p> Hierarchical Clustering is a method of cluster analysis that builds a tree-like structure(dendrogram). Although there are different types of Hirerchical clustering, Agglomerative approcah. </p>

<h5>Euclidean Distance</h5>
<p>Measures the distance between data points or clusters to decide how to merge or split clusters.</p>
<h5>Linkage Criteria</h5>
<p>Determines how the distance between clusters is computed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Single Linkage: distance from nearest neighbor.</li>
    <li>Complete Linkage:distance from farthest neighbor.</li>
    <li>Centroid Linkage:Uses the distance between the centroids (mean) of the clusters.* careful - Sensitive to outliers*.</li>
</ul>
