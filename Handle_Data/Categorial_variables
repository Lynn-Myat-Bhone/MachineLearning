Categorical_variables
====================

A categorical variable takes only a limited number of values.
You will get an error if you try to plug these variables into most machine learning models in Python without preprocessing them first.

Three Approach
    1. Drop Columns that contain categorical values.
    2. Ordinal Encoding : assigns each unique value to a different integer.
    3. One-Hot Encoding 

Which method is the best?
    - use MAE to compare approach, the best approcah the lower the MAE.
