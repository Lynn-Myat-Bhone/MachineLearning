Reinforcement learning consists of several key concepts:

Agent is the entity being trained. In our example, this is a dog.
Environment is the “world” in which the agent interacts, such as a park.
Actions are performed by the agent in the environment, such as running around, sitting, or playing ball.
Rewards are issued to the agent for performing good actions.
