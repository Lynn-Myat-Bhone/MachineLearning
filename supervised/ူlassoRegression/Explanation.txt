LassoRegression (L1 Regression)
===============================

LassoRegression is similar to Ridge Regression. 

    => lasso = sum of all square residuals + lamda * |slope|

    difference is RidgeRegression can only shrinks the slope close to 0 while 
    LassoRegression can shrinks all the way to 0.
