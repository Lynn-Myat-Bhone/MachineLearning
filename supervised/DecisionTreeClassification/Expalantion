Decision Tree(Regression)
=============

Decision Tree is a Tree like structure and  hierarchical.

                        Does house has 2 bedrooms
                                    |
                            No  /        \ Yes
                        Price $10000       Price $13000 

That is Decision tree .

When do we stop growing Decision Tree. This is important because it can cause overfitting or underfitting.    

    We use Stopping Conditions for stop the tree. The most common sttopping condition is to limit the maximum depth(max_depth) of the tree.

some commonly used splitting criteria in decision tree models. They are 

Classification error 
 
        1- (number of majority of data point / total number of data points)

Geni index 

    probability = no. of "Yes"/total number 

      gini impurities within one leaves (GL)1- (the probability of "Yes")squared - (the probability of "No")squared

      total gini impurity = weight average of Gini impurities of the leaves
                          = (total no."Yes" in leaf/total no. of data points )*GL + (total no."Yes" in leaf/total no. of data points )*GL
